# MissionCoordination-TP-ROS
This project is simulating 3 robots using ROS 1 &amp; Gazebo. The goal is to compute and display move them from start point to their flags while avoiding collisions. Main goal is to reach the flags as fast as possible. The robots are eauipped with limited range ultrasonic sensor, motorized wheels &amp; known position &amp; orientation.
